### API Documentation

- Swagger UI: https://fishair.org/api/docs

These interactive documentation pages allow you to explore the available API endpoints and test them directly from your browser.

### API Key

Some API endpoints might require an API key for authentication. To obtain an API key, please contact Xiaojun Wang at xwang48@tulane.edu for an API key. Please don't share your api key with others.
To authenticate a request, include the access token in the `x-api-key` header of the request. For example, using Python's `requests` library:

```python
import requests

url = "http://fishair.org/api/docs/{protected-endpoint}"
headers = {"x-api-key": f"Bearer {your_api_keyn}"}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

```
